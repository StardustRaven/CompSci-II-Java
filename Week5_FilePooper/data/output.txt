[WatcherNotes]

The Hearth remained quiet throughout the night as embers settled into a steady glow and the air stayed warm.

Market activity resumed at first light with traders setting up stalls and cats resuming their unofficial patrol duties.

Watcher reports indicate no perimeter breaches though morale remains variable depending on sleep quality.

Kitchen operations are nominal with soup simmering tea steeping and bread warming near the fire.

Multiple attempts by large dogs to occupy laps were recorded resulting in mild furniture stress.

System assessment complete; recommendation logged: coffee required, immediately.
